What It Does:

Custom Sections: Enter your personal details, work experience, education, skills, and more.
Easy Formatting: The script uses FPDF to create a clean and well-organized PDF resume.
Colorful Design: Customize colors to make your resume stand out from plain white templates.
User-Friendly: Just answer a few questions and the script handles the rest!

How It Works:

Input Information: Youâ€™ll be asked to provide details like your name, job title, and experience.
Generate Resume: The script formats your information and creates a PDF document.
Save and Use: Your resume is saved as a PDF file that you can easily share.
